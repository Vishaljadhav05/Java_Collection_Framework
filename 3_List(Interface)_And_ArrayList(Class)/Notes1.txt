=> List & ArrayList in Java

=> List Interface :-
-> List is a interface which is present in java.util package
-> List is the child interface of Collection interface
-> Syntax : public interface List extends Collection { - }
-> List was introduced in JDK 1.2 version
-> Hierarchy of List interface :-

=>  Properties of List Interface :-
1. List is an index based Data Structure which means that first element will be inserted at 0 index position
2. List can store different data types or heterogeneous elements
3. We can store duplicate elements in the List
4. We can store any number of null values in the List
5. List follows the insertion order which means the sequence in which we are inserting the elements, in the same sequence we can retrieve the elements
6. List does not follow the sorting order.


=> Methods of List Interface :-
1. List contains all the methods of Collection interface
2. void add(int index, Object obj);
3. boolean addAll(int index, Collection c);
4. Object get(int index);
5. Object remove(int index);
7. 6. Object set(int index, Object newobj); //set method is used to replace the object at given index position
8. 7. int indexOf(Object obj); //it will return the index position of provided object and if object is not found then it will return -1
9. int lastIndexOf(Object obj);


=> ArrayList :-
-> ArrayList is an implemented class of List interface which is present in java.util package.
-> Syntax : public class ArrayList extends AbstractList implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable.
-> The underline Data-Structure of ArrayList is resizable array or growable array.
-> ArrayList was introduced in JDK 1.2 version.

-> Properties of ArrayList :-
1. ArrayList is an index based Data Structure which means that first element will be inserted at 0 index position.
2. ArrayList can store different data types elements or hetrogeneous elements.
3. We can store duplicate elements in the ArrayList.
4. We can store any number of null values in the ArrayList.
5. ArrayList follows the insertion order which means the sequence in which we are inserting the elements, in the same 
    sequence we can retrieve the elements.
6. ArrayList does not follow the sorting order.
(above properties are same as List interface)
7. ArrayList is non-synchronized collection because ArrayList does not contain any synchronized method.
8. ArrayList allows more than one thread at one time.
9. ArrayList allows parallel execution.
10. ArrayList reduces the execution time which in turn makes the application fast.
11. ArrayList is not threadsafe.
12. ArrayList does not gurantee for data consistency.

=> Working of an ArrayList :-
1. When we create default ArrayList, a new ArrayList with initial capacity 10 is created (but size is 0).
2. When the ArrayList capacity is full, a new ArrayList will be created with new capacity.
    The new Capacity is calculated by this formula:-
        a. (CurrentCapacity * 3 / 2) + 1
3. Then all the elements will be copied into the new ArrayList (and due this this reason performance of an ArrayList decreases).
4. When new ArrayList is created automatically, then reference variable will point to the new ArrayList.
5. Then old ArrayList object will be not referenced by any reference and then garbage collection will delete that object.

Note : There is no way by which we can find the capacity of an ArrayList.
