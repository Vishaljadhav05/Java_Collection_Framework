## 👉 List & ArrayList in Java

### ➤ List Interface :-
- 📦 List is a interface which is present in `java.util` package
- 🔗 List is the child interface of Collection interface
- 🧩 Syntax : `public interface List extends Collection { - }`
- 🕰️ List was introduced in **JDK 1.2 version**
- 🌳 Hierarchy of List interface :-

## ✨ Properties of List Interface :-

1.  List is an index based Data Structure which means that first element will be inserted at **0 index position**
2.  List can store different data types or **heterogeneous elements**
3.  We can store **duplicate elements** in the List
4.  We can store **any number of null values** in the List
5.  List follows the **insertion order** which means the sequence in which we are inserting the elements, in the same sequence we can retrieve the elements
6.  List does **not follow the sorting order**

## 🛠️ Methods of List Interface :-

1. 🧩 List contains all the methods of Collection interface
2. ➕ `void add(int index, Object obj);`
3. ➕➕ `boolean addAll(int index, Collection c);`
4. 🎯 `Object get(int index);`
5. ❌ `Object remove(int index);`
6. 🔄 `Object set(int index, Object newobj);`  
   👉 set method is used to replace the object at given index position
7. 🔍 `int indexOf(Object obj);`  
   👉 it will return the index position of provided object and if object is not found then it will return **-1**
8. 🔎 `int lastIndexOf(Object obj);`

## 📗 ArrayList :-

- 📦 ArrayList is an implemented class of List interface which is present in `java.util` package.
- 🧩 Syntax :  
  `public class ArrayList extends AbstractList implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable.`
- 🧠 The underline Data-Structure of ArrayList is **resizable array or growable array**.
- 🕰️ ArrayList was introduced in **JDK 1.2 version**.

## ✨ Properties of ArrayList :-

1. 📌 ArrayList is an index based Data Structure which means that first element will be inserted at **0 index position**.
2. 🧬 ArrayList can store different data types elements or **hetrogeneous elements**.
3. 🔁 We can store **duplicate elements** in the ArrayList.
4. 🚫 We can store **any number of null values** in the ArrayList.
5. 📥 ArrayList follows the **insertion order** which means the sequence in which we are inserting the elements, in the same sequence we can retrieve the elements.
6. ❌ ArrayList does **not follow the sorting order**.

👉 (Above properties are same as List interface)

7. 🔓 ArrayList is **non-synchronized collection** because ArrayList does not contain any synchronized method.
8. 🧵 ArrayList allows **more than one thread at one time**.
9. ⚡ ArrayList allows **parallel execution**.
10. 🚀 ArrayList reduces the execution time which in turn makes the application fast.
11. ⚠️ ArrayList is **not threadsafe**.
12. ❗ ArrayList does **not gurantee for data consistency**.

## ⚙️ Working of an ArrayList :-

1. 🆕 When we create default ArrayList, a new ArrayList with **initial capacity 10** is created (but size is **0**).
2. 📈 When the ArrayList capacity is full, a new ArrayList will be created with new capacity.  
   The new Capacity is calculated by this formula :-  
   ➤ **(CurrentCapacity * 3 / 2) + 1**
3. 📋 Then all the elements will be copied into the new ArrayList (and due this this reason performance of an ArrayList decreases).
4. 🔗 When new ArrayList is created automatically, then reference variable will point to the new ArrayList.
5. 🗑️ Then old ArrayList object will be not referenced by any reference and then **garbage collection** will delete that object.

### 📝 Note :-
❗ There is **no way by which we can find the capacity of an ArrayList**.
